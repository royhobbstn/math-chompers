This project is a React + TypeScript implementation of a Number Munchers-style math game. The game should feature:
- A grid of numbers
- A player character (the Muncher) that moves with arrow keys
- Troggle enemies that move around the grid
- Rules for eating correct numbers (multiples, factors, primes, etc.)
- Child-friendly, colorful UI faithful to the original gameplay
- Placeholder assets for characters and grid
- State management for game logic

Copilot should generate code that is modular, readable, and easy to extend for new math rules or features.
